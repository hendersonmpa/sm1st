* Summary 

- This analysis uses data from sm1st and aaac tables in the sm database
  - this data was pulled from the AIH
- Results from SM1ST run on Bill was compared to AAAC run on Larry, Joe and Jenna Jr
- Patient samples, CDC linearity materials and qualitity control
  materials are used to span a range of values relevant to newborns
  screening


** Primary Amino Acids
- [X] Ala
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:Ala_pop]])
- [X] Arg
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:Arg_pop]])
- [ ] ASA
  - ASA not measured in AAAC method, Cit/ASA comparison required
- [X] Cit
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:Cit_pop]])
  - what happened in mid May?(Figure [[fig:Cit_ts]])
    - change in transition table
  - population data trimmed to after mid may
- [X] Leu
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:Leu_pop]])
- [X] Met
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:Met_pop]])  
- [X] Phe
   - Use the population based RRF (Figures [[fig:Phe_pop]], [[fig:Phe_ts]])
- [X] Tyr
  - removed population data prior to May 15tha
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:Tyr_pop]])  
- [X] SUAC
  - Neither population or QC RRF adjustments work well
  - Additional analysis and review was done (see SUAC comparison documents)
- [X] GUAC
  - use the QC based RRF (Figures [[fig:GUAC_QC_pop]] , [[fig:GUAC_QC_ts]])
** Primary Acylcarnitines

- [X] C0
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:C0_pop]])  
- [X] C2
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:C2_pop]])  
- [X] C3
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:C3_pop]])  
- [X] C5
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:C5_pop]], [[fig:C5_ts]])
- [X] C5DC
  - use the population based RRF adjustment (Figure [[fig:C5_pop]], [[fig:C5_ts]])
  - send more samples to second tier analysis to resolve C5DC from C6OH
- [X] C6
  - use the QC based RRF (Figures [[fig:C6_QC_pop]], [[fig:C6_QC_ts]])
- [X] C8
  - use the population based RRF adjustment (Figure [[fig:C8_pop]], [[fig:C8_ts]])
- [X] C10
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:C10_pop]], [[fig:C10_ts]])  
- [X] C141
  - use the QC based RRF (Figures [[fig:C141_QC_pop]], [[fig:C141_QC_ts]])
- [X] C16
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:C16_pop]], [[fig:C16_ts]])  
- [X] C16OH
  - use the QC based RRF (Figures [[fig:C16OH_QC_pop]], [[fig:C16OH_QC_ts]])
- [X] C18 
  - use the population based RRF (Figure [[fig:C18_pop]], [[fig:C18_ts]])
